# 4.4  Expanding Purpose

## Overview

Behaviors are intended to define various aspects of an application's literal behavior under various contextual circumstances. These circumstances and the functionality of the behavior through its operations define its purpose. Previously, the circumstances were only defined by the contexts themselves and any qualifications that the behavior may have for them, but there are settings for a behavior's contexts that can expand the purpose further.

These settings, described below, can be used individually or in combination to affect a change in how a behavior obtains or manages its contexts. The logging feature worked on throughout this chapter can be expanded upon to better discuss what these settings can do:

```
*Update logging to use explicit routers.
```



## Exclusivity

Exclusivity pertains to how contexts might be shared between behaviors.&#x20;

\[Exclusivity applied to share `Log Settings` between router behaviors.]



By default, the contexts of a behavior are unique to a single instance of a behavior.&#x20;

\[Consider the `Perform Logging` behavior that has been worked on throughout this chapter. It depends on a `Log Settings` context. If there were two `Log Settings` contexts, there would (per the latest implementation) be two `Perform Logging` behavior instances, one for each `Log Settings` context. The `Log Message` contexts would also only end up qualifying for only one of those two behavior instances at a time. Given that the behavior uses a bucket, any `Log Message` contexts that qualify for both behaviors would be split between the two behavior instances.]



## Fulfillment

\[Fulfillment applied to the relationship between Log Settings and App State.]



## Specifiers

\[Specifiers applied to destroying the routers when the Log Settings is destroyed, and Log Settings when App State's behavior is destroyed.]
