## The Concept of Behavior

A "Behavior" is a construct that provides additional meaning to its required, and qualifying, contexts, with encapsulated operations that can react[^1] to changes in those contexts. The contexts associated with a behavior form a relationship that can be leveraged by the behavior and other behaviors/operations, [as seen later](../chapter-5-evaluating-through-compositions/5.1-composing-contexts.md). This reactivity and the conditional associations between contexts and their shared operations is at the heart of Contextual Programming, enabling programmers to more effectively develop dynamic applications.

[^1]: React, in this sense, means to be automatically performed. More specifically, behavior operations can be declared to be performed if a behavior's context(s) change in some way.
