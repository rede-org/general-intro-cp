# 4.1  Revisiting Hello World!

## The Concept of Behavior

A "Behavior" is a construct that provides additional meaning to its required, and qualifying, contexts, with encapsulated operations that can react[^1] to changes in those contexts. The contexts associated with a behavior form a relationship that can be leveraged by the behavior and other behaviors/operations, [as seen later](../chapter-5-evaluating-through-compositions/5.1-composing-contexts.md). This reactivity and the conditional associations between contexts and their shared operations is at the heart of Contextual Programming, enabling programmers to more effectively develop dynamic applications.



## Registering

Before going over the internals of a behavior, it's best to understand how a behavior exists and what to expect of it. Behaviors require contexts that have been "registered" to persist. So far, there have been not such contexts registered. Doing so can be done with this generalized syntax, within an operation:

```
await some context as Registration
```

All contexts can be aliased as a `Registration`, which is a built-in construct that initiates functionality to persist the context, in this case, some instance of a context called `some context`. Once this is done, a behavior that requires a context of the same type as `some context` can evaluate `some context` to see whether it qualifies to be associated with the behavior and its other contexts, that is, if all of its required contexts exist and qualify.

One of the most basic behaviors is one that was, unknowingly, being used back in the [original Hello World! example](../chapter-3-evaluating-with-operations/3.1-hello-world.md). That code was:

```
// Some code
```

\[Discuss the original code. Discuss how that was making a Console Output to activate the behavior. Detail how that can be done directly to give more control.]



## Deregistering

\[Detail the concept of deregistering and what that means for a behavior.]

[^1]: React, in this sense, means to be automatically performed. More specifically, behavior operations can be declared to be performed if a behavior's context(s) change in some way.
