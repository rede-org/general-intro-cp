# 4.2  From 'When' to 'Whenever'

## A Basic Behavior

When [revisiting Hello World!](4.1-revisiting-hello-world.md), a behavior that uses `Console Output` and `Console Message` was described. While it's great to understand the built-in behaviors of Rede, to really take advantage of Contextual Programming, one must be able to create behaviors. The generalized syntax to do so is very similar to that of an [operation group](../chapter-3-evaluating-with-operations/3.3-operation-groups.md), [as follows](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]:

```
"Behavior Identifier" ::
    "Behavior name with [Context Types]": {"Context Names"} "Qualifications"?
    {
        [An Operation]
        [Another Operation]
    }.
```

There's an optional identifier, a name with specified context types, the names associated to those context types, any qualifications, then the behavior's operations. The symbols used throughout are the same, except the context names are enclosed in `{ }` instead of `< >`.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As explained [previously](../chapter-3-evaluating-with-operations/3.2-expanding-on-when.md#operations-with-multiple-contexts), the use of `< >` for operations is used in both an operation declaration and to explicitly define an operable to be awaited. This creates a consistent connection between `< >` being used to signify a concept of operations. It has also been [previously](../chapter-3-evaluating-with-operations/3.3-operation-groups.md#getting-the-input) mentioned ([twice](../chapter-2-creating-context/2.1-organizing-data.md#defining-a-context)) that `{ }` denotes some kind of collection. In the case of a behavior declaration, it is a collection of contexts, which is referred to in Contextual Programming as a 'composition'.

Just as [operables have a purpose](../chapter-6-abstracting-evaluations/6.1-composing-operables.md) for operations, [compositions have a purpose](../chapter-5-evaluating-through-compositions/5.1-composing-contexts.md) which will create consistency behind this specific use of `{ }` for behaviors.

### Logging

Logging[^2] is a relatively simple feature that can be implemented and expanded upon as more behavior concepts are described. To start logging, there will need to be a couple of contexts:

```
`Describe logging contexts.`
```

Then the behavior declaration.

```
`The logger behavior.`
```

Last, the actual logging, which for now will just be to the console.

```
`Operation to handle logging to the console on initialization.`
```

\[Explain some of the operation's functionality.]

## Understanding the Cycle



[^1]: As a reminder, text within double quotations here would be replaced by text meaningful to an actual declaration. Text within square brackets signifies that specific names defined within the code should replace the text.

[^2]: A logger is usually an abstraction for where the output of an application will be written, for example, whether it's to the console or a file. Loggers also may provide some control over exactly what is output.
