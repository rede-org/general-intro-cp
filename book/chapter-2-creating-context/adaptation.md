# Adaptation

## Overview

The first example of a context, `Some Int: context Int.`, described itself as an adaptation. Adaptation is a type of inheritance[^1] for Contextual Programming. A context is primarily data being organized and presented in a manner most appropriate for the use of that context, so adaptation focuses only on enabling a context/record, called the descendant, to inherit the desired parts of another context/record, called the ancestor, and to present those parts appropriately for its use.

Adaptations have three primary purposes.



## Aliasing





## Excluding





## Extending



[^1]: Inheritance is a concept of Object-Oriented Programming. Usually, inheritance defines a parent type (sometimes called a superclass) for a child type (sometimes called a subclass). The child type inherits any defined properties and functionality of the parent type. An instance of the child type can usually be used as an instance of the parent type.
