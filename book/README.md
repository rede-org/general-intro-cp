# A General Introduction to Contextual Programming

By Lucas Stertz



## Overview

This book describes the concepts of Contextual Programming, a paradigm for developing software.&#x20;

### Who is this for?

This book is intended to be understandable and educational to both new and experienced programmers. It is expected that more experienced programmers may have a more difficult time understanding the basic concepts of Contextual Programming, while new programmers may struggle more with the advanced concepts. This difference in perception is anticipated due to how the paradigm requires different patterns of thought than most existing paradigms.

If the reader is familiar with another paradigm and is finding it difficult to shift their perspective to this paradigm, it is recommended that they review one of the following books instead:

* Contextual Programming: An Introduction from Object-Oriented Programming (not yet available)
* Contextual Programming: An Introduction from Functional Programming (not yet available)

### Code Examples

Examples are provided to give a more concrete understanding of the concepts. All code is written in the [Rede programming language](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/FfOPeCfV66IeaZZd4Exu/), however, not all features of that language will be used, and this book is not intended to be used as a learning resource for Rede. There are many features of Rede that simplify development and encourage best practices for more maintainable and scalable development. The reader is advised to explore those features when they feel comfortable with the concepts of Contextual Programming.

Readers are encouraged to experiment with the code examples on their own to further their understanding, but there are no explicit assignments defined by this book.
