# 3.2  Expanding on 'When'

## Operation Conditions

In the[ Hello World example](3.1-hello-world.md), `when initialized` was introduced as a Circumstantial Control Flow qualification. However, `when` can specify many other qualifications. Most often these qualifications will be conditions that the contexts of an operation must meet for the operation to be performed.

A simple example can be one that checks whether an input number is even. As before, it's best to [define the context](../chapter-2-creating-context/2.1-organizing-data.md#defining-a-context) that we will use first:

```
Input Number: context Int.
```

Then the entry point to the application, where the user will be asked to provide a number:

```
Even Checker: when initialized?
    await "Please enter a number." as Console Message,
    await response: Console Response;
    await response to Input Number.
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Notice how `Console Response` is being converted to an `Input Number` using the `to` keyword. A `Console Response` is itself an alias for a `String` which, in Rede, has a built-in mapping to an `Int` which `Input Number` is an alias for. This mapping will attempt to convert the `String` to an `Int` in any way that it can, and if it can't, then an error will be thrown.

There are ways to check that a `String` and can be safely converted to an `Int`, but for simplicity, this example assumes the user will provide a number when asked.
{% endhint %}

This initial operation requests a number from the user, then waits for the response, and then awaits any operations that handle the response as an `Input Number`. Here is an operation to do just that:

```
Notify Of An Even Input Number: <number> when number % 2 = 0?
    await "That number is even!" as Console Message.
```

This operation will be performed for an awaited `Input Number` which it will call `number`. `number` must be even (modulus[^1] 2, leaving no remainder) for the operation to be performed, as specified by `when number % 2 = 0`. Upon being performed, the operation sends a console message that the number is even.

It may be nice to also notify the user of when the number is not even, which can be done with this similarly looking operation:

```
Notify Of A Not Even Input Number: <number> when number % 2 = 1?
    await "That number is not even!" as Console Message.
```



## Working with Aliases

\[Detail how Console Response can be aliased as an Unvalidated Int String, with a Validated Int String, which can then be safely converted to Input Number for other use. If Validate Int String (Is Valid Int) is false, then a different message can be provided.]



## Identifiers and Execution Order

\[Detail identifiers and how operations can coordinate among each other with execution order.]

[^1]: Modulus is represented by `%` in Rede, as it is in many other languages as well.
