# 3.1  Hello World!

## Overview

For an application to progress, the state of its contexts must be changed. Operations are the constructs that, at a high-level, define when those contexts are changed/created, and at a more detailed level, how they are changed.

In general, a simple operation that has no required contexts has a declaration that looks like [the following](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]:

```
"Operation Name": "Qualifications"? "Operation Logic".
```

{% hint style="info" %}
An operation's name can really be anything since it isn't directly referenced anywhere else in the code. It's recommended that these names are self-documenting[^2].
{% endhint %}

Qualifications are where the 'when' aspect of Contextual Programming is defined. Statements after the `:` and before the `?` are all considered qualifications and often take the form of `when "some condition"`, but they can also have other forms that will be shown later.

Operation logic is a series of statements that either creates new contexts, directly manipulates the operation's contexts (if it has any), or specifies other operations that may qualify to alter specific contexts.

## A Simple Operation

One of the simplest examples of an operation is Rede's (simplest[^3]) implementation of the classic "Hello World!" program:

```
Main: when initialized?
    run "Hello World!" as Console Message.
```

## Multiple Operations



[^1]: As before, text within double quotations here would be replaced by text meaningful to an actual declaration.

[^2]: Self-documenting means that the code serves its intended purpose as code but is also expressive enough when read to convey the actual use and meaning of the code, thus reducing the need to write separate documentation to provide that information.

[^3]: In programming, there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same goal. In this case, the simplest implementation is the shortest and most streamlined version, but it has less flexibility and provides less control than other implementations.
